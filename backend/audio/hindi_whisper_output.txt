JERMINY HAS OVER TWO MILLENIA OF HISTORY, DURING WHICH IT HAD ESTABLISHED SEALF AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRYS IN THE WORLD. BURLEY HISTORY THE DREAMANIC TRYBS ARE THOUGHT TO DATE BACK TO THE NORTIC BRONS-AGE DURING WHICH THEY EXPANDED THEIR TERRITORY AND CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE CELTAIC, IRANIAN, BALTIK AND SLavic TRYBS. BY THE TIME OF ROMAN GENERAL, JULIUS SEASURE, THE DREAMANIC PEOPLE OR DREAMANI, WE'RE ESTABLISHED EAST OF THE RINE RIVER IN THE LANDS HE REFERED TO AS DREAMANIA. UNDER SEASURE AT GUSTIS, THE FIRST ROMAN EMPERER, THE ROMAN EMPIRE CREATED A ROMAN PROVENTS CALLED DREAMANIA AND QUIET. AREAS THAT REMAINED OUT OF ROMAN CONTROL REFERED TO AS MAGNA DREAMANIA. IN THE 4TH SENTRY, THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS INVADED BY DIFFERENT TRYBS, EVENTIALLY LEADING TO THE FALL OF THE WEST AND ROMAN EMPIRE IN 476 AD. AFTER THAT, LARGE PARTS OF DREAMANIA EVENTIALLY BEKING PART OF THE FRANKISH EMPIRE, AND LATER EAST FRANCEA. IN 800, THE FRANKISH KING CHARLAMANE WAS CROWNED EMPERER OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE, OF WHICH DREAMAN TERRITORIES FORMED A SENTRAL PART. IN THE NEXT SENTURES, THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE BECAME MORE COMPLICATED WITH OVER 1,000 separate territories under distinct authorities in 1789. FOLLOWING A DEFIEF by Napoleon I, at the Battle of Osterlitz, in 1806, the Empire was dissolved by Francis II, the last Holy Roman Emperor. GERMAN CONFEDERATION AND GERMAN EMPIRE Napoleon's reign came to an end, in 1815, with the Congress of Vienna, forming the German confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign German states, most notably of which were the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. In the early 19th century, the German question was raised within the confederation, between the greater German solution to form a single German nation state and the lesser German solution to conserve the current federation of smaller German states. The farmer was promoted by Austria, while the latter was supported by Prussia. From the mid-1840s, rebellions leading to the 1848 revolution broke out in the German states. Nearly two decades later, war broke out between Austria and Prussia and ended the victory of Prussia, leading to the collapse of the German confederation. The following year, the North German confederation was formed with Prussia and its allies, spaving the way for the formation of the German Empire with Prussian King William I as Emperor. In 1914, Germany led the Central power in World War I against the Allied power. Following its defeat five years later, Germany was severely punished by the Treaty of Versailles, leading to the loss of 13% of its European territory. The Weimar Republic in Nazi Germany The German revolution ended the German Empire and established the Weimar Republic. The war reparations, hyperinflation and the Great Depression resulted in economic hardship in post-war Germany, aiding Adolf Hitler's rise to power. The following year, Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party, was appointed Chancellor and then dictator of Germany, beginning the transformation of the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany. Under Hitler's rule, Nazi Germany became increasingly aggressive and threatened to wage a territory war. In 1938, the Nazis annexed Austria and then Czechoslovakia. One year later, it invaded Poland, initiating World War II. Following its invasion of the Soviet Union, Germany and the access powers occupied most of continental Europe. During the war, the Holocaust, led by the Nazis, murdered 17 million people across German occupied Europe, of which 6 million were Jews. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy, the Germans received continuous defeats. Following Hitler's suicide, Germany surrendered on the 8th of May 1945, marking the end of World War II in Europe. Post-World War II and reunification of Germany. Following its surrender, Germany was partitioned into four occupation zones occupied by the US, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union. In May 1949, the France, US and Great Britain occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany or West Germany. Meanwhile, the Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic or East Germany. The Berlin Wall was built to divide East Berlin from West Berlin. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1990, the 2 plus 4 treaty was negotiated between the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the four powers occupying Germany, allowing the official reunification of Germany later that year. Berlin again became the capital of Germany. Today Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, G7, G20 and the OECD and is one founding nation of the Eurozone. Germany is currently a great power with the largest economy in Europe, being the world's 4th largest economy by nominal GDP.
